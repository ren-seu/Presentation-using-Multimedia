        <h1>What is a Monitor?</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div class="text">
        <p>A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by a connected computer through the computer's video card.
            Monitors are similar to TVs, but usually display information at a much higher resolution. Also, unlike televisions, monitors typically sit atop a desk rather than being mounted on a wall. 
            A monitor is sometimes referred to as a screen, display, video display, video display terminal, video display unit, or video screen. On a desktop computer, the monitor connects via a cable to a port on the computer's video card or motherboard. Even though the monitor sits outside the main computer housing, it's an essential part of the system.
            It's important to differentiate between the monitor and the actual computer, especially on a desktop system. Shutting off a monitor connected to the computer isn't the same as powering down the actual computer, whose components (such as the hard drive and video card) are housed within the computer case.
            Monitors are built-in as part of the computer in laptops, tablets, netbooks, and all-in-one desktop machines. However, you can buy one separately if you want to upgrade from your current monitor or configure a multi-monitor setup. 
            Monitors come in two major types, LCD and CRT. CRT monitors, which are deep in size, look like old-fashioned TVs. LCD monitors are much thinner, use less energy, and provide better graphics quality. OLED is another type of monitor that's an improvement on LCD, providing even better color and viewing angles, but also requiring more power.      
            LCD monitors have obsoleted CRT monitors due to the higher quality, smaller footprint on a desk, and decreasing price of LCDs. However, OLED monitors are still more expensive and therefore not as widely used in the home.</p>
